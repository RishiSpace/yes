# This workflow builds your project and commits the build output to a 'deploy' branch.
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Create a folder named .github/workflows in the root of your repository.
# 2. Save this file as 'build-and-deploy.yml' (or any .yml name) inside that folder.
# 3. Push this file to your 'main' branch.
#
# On the next push to 'main', this action will run.

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout 🛎️
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js 🟩
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          # Specify the Node.js version you use
          node-version: '20'
          # Use npm caching to speed up subsequent builds
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies 👨‍💻
        # 'npm ci' is recommended for CI environments for faster, reliable installs
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run the build script for Vite
      - name: Build Project 🏗️
        env: # Set an env var for Vite to use
          VITE_PUBLIC_URL: /yes/
        run: npm run build -- --base=${VITE_PUBLIC_URL}
        # We pass the VITE_PUBLIC_URL to two places:
        # 1. The '--base' flag, so Vite builds assets with the right path.
        # 2. 'import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_URL' (inside your React code),
        #    so React Router knows the base path.

      # Step 4.5: Create 404.html fallback for SPA routing
      - name: Create 404.html for SPA Fallback 📄
        run: cp dist/index.html dist/404.html
        # This copies the index.html to 404.html.
        # When GitHub Pages can't find a sub-route (e.g., /yes/about),
        # it serves the 404.html file, which is your app.
        # Your app's router then correctly loads the /about page.

      # Step 5: Deploy the build output to the 'deploy' branch
      - name: Deploy to 'deploy' branch 🚀
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          # The name of the branch to deploy to
          branch: deploy
          
          # The name of the folder containing your build output
          # Common names are 'dist', 'build', or 'out'.
          # Change this to match your project's build output directory.
          folder: dist
          
          # This will automatically create the 'deploy' branch if it doesn't exist
          # and force-push the new build, overwriting the previous contents.
